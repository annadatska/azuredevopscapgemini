Practical Task 5: Creating and Assigning Basic Azure Policies
Define and assign Azure Policies to enforce compliance with organizational standards for resource 
management.
Requirements:

Environment: Development).
2. Assign the policy to a resource group.
3. Verify that any new resource created in the resource group without the required tag is marked as 
non-compliant.
4. Review and document the compliance status of the resource group.
