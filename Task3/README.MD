Practical Task 3: Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure to manage access to resources based on roles and 
ensure fine-grained access management.
Requirements:
1. Create a custom role named Resource Viewer with read-only permissions for a specific resource 
group.
2. Assign the Resource Viewer role to the Developers group created earlier.
3. Assign the built-in Contributor role to the Admins group for the same resource group.
4. Verify that members of the Developers group have only read access and members of the Admins
group have full access to the resource group.
